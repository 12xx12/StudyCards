# StudyCards

This repo contains my collection of study cards on the Master at the University
of Augsburg :mortar_board:

Pull request are welcome!

## Contents

The repo contains a csv file for each lecture. The chapters are sometimes
determined by the lecture, sometimes by myself. **I don't claim that everything
is complete.** The app Supports images but doesn't export them, some answers
might be empty.

For more information check the [Lectures File](LECTURES.md).

## Warnings

The math based cards contain Latex code. The Code isn't rendered by the app I
use. This might seem unreadable. SORRY

## Editor
